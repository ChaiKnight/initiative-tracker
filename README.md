# initiative-tracker
A simple initiative tracker for DnD tomorrow night

If you want to use it too, just run the script. The first box takes an int (initiative) and the second the name.

You can remove individual entries or clear batches when your murder hobos kill everything.

I will add editing later so you dont have to re-add the players every combat.
